# Unit-Conversion

This Android mobile app was developed as part of an assignment for my university course. Listed below is basic and further
functionality for the assignment, both of which I chose to complete.
The assignment is as follows:

The project should include the following functionality:
- The first screen should allow the user to select the two units in a user friendly way, ideally using a spinner or even picker.
- The second screen is expected to look a bit like a calculator allowing the user to type in a value for the conversion. There 
  should also be a button to clear any previous input and perhaps a second button to initiate the conversion. However, you may 
  also consider implementing automatic conversion as the user types in the value.
- The second screen should also state what units were selected on the first page.

At the most basic level, your application should:
- Support two fragments
- Be able to accept user input for the given unit and the target unit (on the first fragment), as well as a numeric value for the 
  conversion (on the second fragment).
- Convert the value into the target unit
- Offer a fixed set of at least four unit conversions (e.g. meter to yards, miles to yards, grams to ounces, kilograms to pounds).

Further functionality and refinement:
The functionality listed above is what is expected of a basic app. However, for additional credit you can refine your application 
further. Rather than hardcoding the four conversions, you may consider using persistent storage for this data. You may also extend 
your application in such a way that the types of conversions your app can do is extendible (but restrict yourself to simple 
conversions involving a single multiplier). Introducing categories of units (distance, weight, speed etc) will allow users to 
select the units more easily as the number of conversions offered grows. A common feature many users expect is that 
the app also works correctly when the screen is rotated and that the app also works nicely on larger screens, e.g. tablets. 
However, you may also have your own ideas for refinement of the app.
